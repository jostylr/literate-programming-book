## Artistic programming

And so we reach the third and final level of our journey. The other two levels
are pretty much complete in explaining them and how to use them. What follows
for the rest of this tome is all about the third level. 

The third level is the shedding of constraints. We take those snippets of code
from the second level and we run them through code transformations. This
enables us to do just about anything. Even more, we can call out to external
programs, feeding the snippets in as standard input and receiving the output
as the next form of the snippet.

This is the level of complete artistry. We can write little mini-languages to
make efficient input. We can use a wide variety of text transformations of one
language to the next all smoothly in the code.
