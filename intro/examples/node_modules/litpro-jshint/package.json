  "readme": "# JSHint\n\nThis is a plugin for [litpro](https://github.com/jostylr/literate-programming). Install that and then you can use this by requiring it in the lprc.js file. \n\nIt is automatically included in [literate-programming](https://github.com/jostylr/literate-programming). \n\nThis plugin provides a single command: `jshint`.  It takes three\narguments:  options, globals, name\n\nOptions should be an object containing [configuration options for\nJSHint](http://jshint.com/docs/options/). This can be conveniently created\nas an argument using the kv subcommand: `| jshint kv(unused, true() ) `\n\nThe second argument is an array for globals. Just write them out. If you\nwant to be able to write to them without a warning, use `:true` after the\nname. So for example `jshint , arr($, console, require, state:true)`\nwould set those variables as globals and allow module to be written to. \n\nThe third argument is a name to be written associated with it. The default\nis roughly of the form `BLOCK: ... FILE: ...`\n",
