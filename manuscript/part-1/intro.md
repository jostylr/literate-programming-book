-# The Basics

What are we trying to do and how do we do it? This should be enough to get you going. 

### What is literate programming? 

A brief description of the philosophy and history of this mode of programming. 

### LitPro

A description of the tool, hopefully enough to get started with it. 

### Semi-literate programming

The first step towards literate programming, this is where comments become elevated to be at least as important, if not more important, than the code. Essentially, comments are the default text mode and code must be initiated. 

### Symphonic programming

Humans do not think in the same way computers process. Respecting the order of human thought is what symphonic programming is about. We cut up the code in many pieces, scatter it around and then the program acts as a conductor to put it all together in a harmonious symphony of beautiful code. 

### Artistic programming

This is the full power of LitPro released. The bits of code can be processed in arbitrary ways. We are not bound by the dictates of the language and can craft the code in whatever elegant manner we wish to craft it. With great power comes the possibilty of making a mess. This is painting code on a canvas with the blending of the bits and pieces in ways that are very powerful.
