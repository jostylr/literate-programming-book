### Constants

We can define constants once with explanations and then put them into whatever files need them. 

### Boiler Plate

If you have need of boiler pate, then we can do that with some substituions for templating it as well.

### Project Files

Often there are other files needing managing for a project other than just code. For example,  .gitignore, readme, package.json, ... These can all live in a single literate programming document tht generates these files. It could also be setup to have variables that you define once and then use when needed, such as the version number. 

### Other languages

If you want to write in your own style or language or whatever, it can do that as well. Write in a way comfortable to you and have it compile it into any target language. 

Example: using hyphens for spaces in javascript. 

Example: math algorithm
