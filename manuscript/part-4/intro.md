-# Reference

This part is the techinical documentation of literate programming. While it does document itself, in some sense, this is a ready index of syntax, directives, commands, subcommands, and plugins.

Most of this applies to literate-programming core library, but there are directives and commands that may only be applicable in the command client. The headings are prefixed with cli: 

### Syntax

#### Commonmark

#### Code blocks

#### Minor Blocks

#### References and Subsitutions

References are what we refer to the chunks of code, or rather, what we call the names of those chunks. 

Substitutions are the syntax saying that something else should go there. Only substitutions and their escaped versions cause a change in the code chunks. 

Substitutions can have null references. The point of these would be the pipes and commands. 

References can occur before the first pipe or as part of a command or as part of a directive.
