# LitPro the Book

This is the project management file for the literate-programming book. 

This book encompasses an introduction to both the methodology and the
particular program. It covers a gentle introduction into using the tools. It
will also delve into some specific applications, notably, web development.
Finally, it is a comprehensive guide to the built-in commands, directives,
subcommands, etc, and a guide to some of its plugins. 

The intention of the first part of the book is to first get one up to speed on
how to use this. The second part delves into some deeper workings. The third
part is the reference manual. The fourth part, not included, is the literate
programming program itself. As all literate programmers know, it should be
written as a literate programming using itself to compile itself. 

This is the second major version of this program that I wrote. The first one
was good, but it lacked an essential asynchronous nature. To facilitate what I
needed, I wrote the event-when library, using the first version of
literate-programming. I then leveraged that library to make the second
version. It is fully event based which allows for such things as running other
programs and including the output into the compiled program. It also makes it
ever so slightly harder to debug.

## Structure

This book is compiled into markdown files that are then compiled by leanpub
into actual books.

Here will be the table of contents




## Reference

The reference section consists of directives, commands, subcommands, and maybe
some other stuff. Each is in a directory of its own.

They will then be organized alphabetically when compiled. 


##  Test

The various code snippets should all be tested automatically, both to make
sure they work as advertised while writing and then also part of the testing
regime for litpro.
