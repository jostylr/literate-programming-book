# Book on Literate Programming

This is the repository for a book using my literate-programming markdown system. When ready enough, you can support this whole endeavor by purchasing it on Leanpub. 

The current plan for the book is to start with an explanation of literate programming in general, some of its uses that apply across most of the implementations. A little history too though not sure how much. Probably a link to a site describing it. 

Then a getting started section for my system: installing node, some words about my own setup, and a few hello examples.

Then we get into the core parts of the system, first from a consuming of what is there and then how to create useful stuff to algroithmically avoid DRY using our stuff. 

The third part would be several project setups that I use (web, js programming, ...?) 

The final part is a manual of sorts for the core part and select plugins.
